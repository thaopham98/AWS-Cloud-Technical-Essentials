When you begin working with the AWS Cloud, managing security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. To depict this shared responsibility, AWS created the shared responsibility model. This distinction of responsibility is commonly referred to as security of the cloud, versus security in the cloud.

### What Is AWS Responsible For?
AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. This means AWS is required to protect and secure the infrastructure that runs all the services offered in the AWS Cloud. AWS is responsible for:

- Protecting and securing AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and data centers, down to the physical security of the buildings
- Managing the hardware, software, and networking components that run AWS services, such as the physical server, host operating systems, virtualization layers, and AWS networking components

The level of responsibility AWS has depends on the service. AWS classifies services into three different categories. The following table provides information about each, as well as the AWS responsibility.
